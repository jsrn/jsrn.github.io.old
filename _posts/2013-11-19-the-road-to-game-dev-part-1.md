Several times in my life, I have attempted to create a videogame. At some point, each project falls by the wayside and sits in a dusty folder, taunting me with its ever growing *"last updated"* field.

When I'm working on a project, I like to think I spend the bulk of my time coding. However, the hurdles I inevitably run into when trying to create a game are nothing to do with my programming abilities.

### Inspiration

When I think about creating a game, I think about all of the amazing games I've played, books I've read, films and TV series I've seen, etc. I think about how these stories have absorbed me, and how attached I've gotten to the characters. I think to myself, *"How can I possibly create anything that isn't total trash by comparison?"*

I decided to embrace this. I might never be as good at writing as the teams of writers who produce the content I love. In fact, it's likely that I never will. That's okay, though, because the aim here isn't to create something amazing. The aim is to create something better than I created the last time. A weak storyline is okay. A blatantly ripped off storyline is okay.

The important thing is to keep working until you have something you can be proud of. Learn first, you can be original later.

### Collaboration

I have always embarked on my game development quests alone. It's good to take a solo project, because you can work on it at your own pace. There's nobody to breathe down your neck, and pester you to keep working on it! On the other hand, you can work on it at your own pace. There's nobody to breathe down your neck, and pester you to keep working on it. 

There are people in this world who would continue to push out amazing content without anyone to push them and keep them going. I am not one of these people.

Fortunately, I've begun reaching out to another aspiring developer. I am hoping that working with another person will help me maintain the motivation that seems to have steadily drained as other projects went on.

### Art

Art assets take an awfully long time to create. I enjoy making game art, but it's not a strength of mine, and I'd really rather be coding. Fortunately, there are a fair amount of free art assets for people to use for their games. If your main goal is learning to make a game, the specifics of the artwork shouldn't be that important. However, your own art assets go a long way to making a game feel like your own, which is a valuable motivational tool.

### The Plan

Make small games. Make stupid, pointless games. Make games with crap art, crap music, crap writing.

Make so many small, crap games that one day I accidentally make a good one.
