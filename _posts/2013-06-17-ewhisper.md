A spin-off of Scattershot, this project aims to blend encryption with the sort of quick and easy private messaging you find on message boards across the internet. By ignoring many of the more complex features that Scattershot is intended to provide, the design can be streamlined into something much easier to quickly develop, and the small surface area of the app lends itself to quick code review, ensuring that people get the privacy that they expect.

### Design Requirements

* The server has no knowledge of the stored text, nor does it have the ability to decrypt it.
* Keys are generated client-side, and the server never has knowledge of a user's private key.
* Accounts should be quick and easy to generate, and require no personal information.
