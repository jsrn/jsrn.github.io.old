\[This post is a work in progress.\]

Twitter is a great service. I have a couple of accounts that I use to follow different circles, and the ability to get real-time news and commentary is unparalleled. To the best of my knowledge, Twitter has so far maintained a good reputation for being fair and secure. I'm sure they've made mistakes, but I have no particular beef with them. 

A decentralised microblogging service should strive to maintain the following traits:

* **Rapid updates** - people are used to near real-time updates from Twitter.
* **Trustworthy** - With any decentralised service, it's vital to be able to verify that the data you receive from other nodes is reliable and accurate.
* **Rapid to deploy** - Not everyone has the technical savvy to maintain their own server, so the app should be as easy to install and configure as possible.

### Scatter Network

Each Scattershot instance would maintain a list of Scattershot instances that it follows, much in the same way that a Twitter user maintains its own list of followers. The scattershot instance can then poll its list of followed instances to create the status update stream for the user.

### Rapid Updates

### Trust

### Deployment
